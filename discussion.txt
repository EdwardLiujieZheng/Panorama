This file is to discuss the following 3 questions on my panorama result "my_panorama.jpg"
1. Describe and discuss any issues that appear in your panorama.
2. Why do the issues appear?
3. Which of the steps above need to be improved to fix those?

1. In my panorama, one major issue is that the middle-right part of the image,
where the bare wall with no windows locates, has been horizontally stretched.
2. The issue appears because there are few salient features on that wall for good alignment,
so that features are matched incorrectly and then the image are warped incorrectly.
3. I need more robust feature matching algorithm to fix the issue.
